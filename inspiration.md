# ExamKlar - Atomic Sprint Plan for AI Execution

## 🤖 AI INSTRUCTIONS - READ THIS FIRST

### How to Use This Plan:
1. **Execute ONE sprint at a time** - Complete all tasks in a sprint before moving to the next
2. **Mark completed tasks** with ✅ and add completion timestamp
3. **Test after each sprint** - Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` to verify no regressions
4. **Update status** - Change sprint status from 🔄 to ✅ when complete
5. **Document issues** - If you encounter problems, add them to the "Issues Encountered" section
6. **Verify before proceeding** - Each sprint builds on the previous, so ensure completion

### Sprint Execution Pattern:
```bash
# Before starting each sprint:
cd /Users/Yousef_1/Dokumenter/HjemmesideIT/EksamensKlar/examklar
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# After completing each sprint:
flutter analyze
flutter test
# Document any remaining issues
```

## ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

### Sprint Issues:
**Sprint 2 - macOS Build Issues:**
- macOS deployment target mismatch (10.14 vs 10.15 required by Firebase)
- Docker Flutter image segmentation fault during pub get
- Long build times for macOS native compilation

### Blockers:
**Resolved:**
- ✅ macOS deployment target incompatibility - Fixed by updating all config files to 10.15
- ✅ Docker build crashes - Bypassed by using direct Flutter web build

### Solutions Applied:
**Sprint 2 Solutions:**
1. **macOS Deployment Target Fix**: Updated `macos/Podfile`, Xcode project settings, and FlutterMacOS.podspec from 10.14 to 10.15
2. **Alternative Build Strategy**: Used `flutter build web --release` instead of problematic Docker/macOS builds
3. **Local Web Server**: Used `python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory build/web` for testing
4. **Best Practice**: Documented that web builds are faster and more reliable for development/testing

**Sprint 5 Solutions:**
1. **Firebase Test Implementation**: Created `SimpleFirebaseTest` component for easy Firebase connection testing
2. **Import Conflict Resolution**: Fixed `AuthProvider` naming conflict by using import aliases (`as app_auth`)
3. **Web Platform Testing**: Successfully verified Firebase works on web platform using Chrome
4. **Test Integration**: Added Firebase test page to app router and dashboard for easy access
