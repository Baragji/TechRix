# TechFlow Solutions - Atomic Sprint Plan for Performance Optimization

## ðŸš€ AI INSTRUCTIONS - READ THIS FIRST

### How to Use This Plan:
1. **Execute ONE sprint at a time** - Complete all tasks in a sprint before moving to the next
2. **Mark completed tasks** with âœ… and add completion timestamp
3. **Test after each sprint** - Run performance audits and verify no regressions
4. **Update status** - Change sprint status from ðŸ”„ to âœ… when complete
5. **Document issues** - If you encounter problems, add them to the "Issues Encountered" section
6. **Verify before proceeding** - Each sprint builds on the previous, so ensure completion

### Sprint Execution Pattern:
```bash
# Before starting each sprint:
cd /Users/Yousef_1/Downloads/TechFlows-main
npm run clear-cache
npm run dev:fresh

# After completing each sprint:
npm run analyze
npm run audit:performance
npm run lighthouse
# Document performance improvements
```

### Performance Baseline (Established 2025-01-21):

  export const LazyMotionWrapper = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
    <LazyMotion features={domMax} strict>
      {children}
    </LazyMotion>
  );

  export { m as motion };
  ```
